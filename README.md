### EV Population Analysis Across the USA

This repository houses a comprehensive project that investigates the annual growth of electric vehicle (EV) ownership across various demographics in the USA. Using Python for data analysis and Tableau for visualization, this project offers deep insights into the evolving landscape of EV adoption.

#### Project Overview

- **Data Analysis**: Leveraging the power of Python, this project conducts sophisticated data analysis to dissect trends and patterns in EV purchases. The analysis pipeline includes data cleaning, manipulation, and aggregation to prepare the dataset for detailed exploration.
- **Visualization**: Utilizing Tableau, we construct interactive dashboards that provide dynamic and user-friendly visual representations of the data. These dashboards allow stakeholders to interact with the information, exploring different demographics and their buying behaviors over time.
- **Insights and Reporting**: The project culminates in a series of insights that are critical for stakeholders interested in the market dynamics of EVs. The findings are documented in clear, accessible reports that summarize the trends in EV adoption.

#### Objectives

- **Demographic Analysis**: Identify which demographics are leading in EV adoption and understand the factors driving their decisions.
- **Geographic Trends**: Examine how different regions in the USA compare in terms of EV market penetration and growth.
- **Market Dynamics**: Provide actionable insights to automotive manufacturers, policymakers, and businesses involved in the EV ecosystem.

This repository is ideal for data analysts, market researchers, policy makers, and anyone interested in the automotive industry, especially in the shift towards more sustainable transportation options.
